## Applied-Data-Science-Capstone
SpaceX Falcon-9 Success Landing Prediction
Predict if SpaceX Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully after rocket launch.
In this capstone, we predict Falcon 9's successful landing and SpaceX's cost savings due to reusing stages.

## Data collection with Webscraping and Data wrangling
## Objectives
Manipulate data in a Pandas data frame.
Create a Pandas data frame by converting a JSON file.
Analyze the data in the Jupyter Notebook environment and make it sharable using GitHub.
Use data science methodologies to define and formulate a real-world business problem, and use data science tools for data analysis.
Share the insight of data after the findings with the stakeholders.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
RESTful API is used for web scraping, converting the data into a data frame, and then performing some data wrangling.

Objectives SQL query used to select and sort data. Data cleaning, processing, and visualization to find insight into the data done by Python.

## Interactive Visual Analytics and Dashboards
Build a dashboard with Plotly Dash, and build an interactive map with Folium Python Library.

## Predictive Analysis(Classification)
Split the data into train-test data. Train different classification models. Used Hyperparameter grid search, and machine learning skills used to build a predictive model to help a business function more efficiently.
